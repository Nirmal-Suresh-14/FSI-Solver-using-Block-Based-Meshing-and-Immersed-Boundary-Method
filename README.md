# FSI-Solver-using-Block-Based-Meshing-and-Immersed-Boundary-Method
Master's Thesis Project for M.Tech in Computational Mechanics at IIT Guwahati

The folder contains the GUI created which will mesh the domain according to requirement based on the concept of 
Block-Based Meshing, coded in Python using Tkinter library.

The created mesh is used to solve the equation on Fortran with the Immersed Boundary Method.
